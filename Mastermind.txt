Abdul Murphy: In Boyd Orr after closing time
Oscar Brown: In 2 places at once 3 times
Alice Patterson: In 2 places at once 1 time, didn't go to morning lecture
Paul Butler: In 2 places at once 1 time
Jonny Craig: Statement and timetable don't match

This narrows it down to 5 possible masterminds: 
Marilyn White
Rosemary Jones    
Scott Johnston    
Charlotte Matthews
Heather Yates   

---

All other timetables match so it has to be one of the people who made a statement, so by inputting each statement person into my mastermind finder these are the results

Name:Matching Timetable
1:Amy Powell:None
2:Danny Thomas:None
3:Stuart Wands:Scott Johnston
4:Chloe Tyler:Scott Johnston,Heather Yates
5:Marc Harrison:Scott Johnston,Heather Yates
6:Gerald Jones:Heather Yates
7:Lee James:None
8:Danielle Cox:None
9:Oscar Brown:None
10:Katie Bell:Scott Johnston,Heather Yates
11:Barry Robinson:Heather Yates
12:Alice Patterson:N/A
13:Beth Jones:None
14:Eric Parkin:Scott Johnston,Heather Yates
15:Angela Jones:None
16:Russell Dixon:None
17:Martin Smith:None
18:Pamela Jones:None
19:Jonny Craig:N/A
20:Melanie Patterson:Scott Johnston
21:Carolyn Bond:None
22:Abdul Murphy:N/A
23:Russell Matthews:None
24:Jill Hill:Scott Johnston,Heather Yates
25:Shaun Yates:Scott Johnston

It cannot be anyone who had multiple results as that would leave it impossible to catch the mastermind with the data we have so this narrows perp 6 to 5 people:
Stuart Wands 
Gerald Jones 
Barry Robinson 
Melanie Patterson
Shaun Yates

---

Gerald Jones and Barry Robinson have statements that clear them so that leaves 3 people all who correlate to Scott Johnston so he is the confirmed mastermind

---

Stuart Wands' statement claims that he got a Tesco meal deal with only ham which is impossible

---

Melanie Patterson has many pauses in her day, which may be he trying to come up with convincing lies, or may be her being tired from being out th previous day

---

Shaun Yates went out into Kelvingrove park for four hours to "sike himself up for minecraft"
